# Simulador de Planificaci贸n
_Simulador de Planificaci贸n_ is a **Hard Disk Drive Scheduling Algorith Simulator** developed as part of the course "[Sistemas Operativos](https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/docnet-nuevo/guia_docent/?centre=305&ensenyament=V05G301V01&assignatura=V05G301V01303&any_academic=2023_24)" in the Telecommunications Engineering Degree at the Universidad de Vigo (2023 - 2024).

## About The Project
This project simulates various disk scheduling algorithms to demonstrate how operating systems handle I/O requests in a hard disk drive. It incorporates theoretical concepts of operating systems and algorithms, showcasing:
- Simulation of real-world hard disk scheduling algorithms.
- Modular and extensible design.
- Customizable parameters for cylinder requests, head position, and timing.

## How To Run

### Requirements
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system. Then install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can execute the simulator by running:

```bash
python src/simulator.py [--cilindros CYLINDERS] [--cola QUEUE] [--algoritmos ALGORITHMS] [--posicion_inicial POSITION] [--tiempo_arranque TIME] [--tiempo_desplazamiento TIME] [--tiempo_detencion TIME] [--tiempo_latencia TIME] [--tiempo_transferencia TIME] [--help]
```

#### Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come, First Served)**  
   The simplest algorithm where requests are handled in the order they arrive. It does not optimize the movement of the disk head and can lead to high seek times.

- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**  
   This algorithm selects the request that requires the least movement of the disk head from its current position, reducing seek time. However, it may cause starvation for requests far from the current head position.

- **SCAN**  
   The disk head moves in one direction, fulfilling all requests until it reaches the end of the disk. It then reverses direction and processes requests in the opposite direction.

- **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**  
   Similar to SCAN, but instead of reversing direction, the disk head jumps back to the start of the disk after reaching the end, processing requests only in one direction.

- **LOOK**  
   A variation of SCAN where the disk head only travels as far as the last request in each direction, avoiding unnecessary movement to the physical end of the disk.

- **C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)**  
   Similar to LOOK, but the head jumps back to the start of the request queue instead of reversing direction.

#### Example
```bash
python simulator.py -c 200 -p 50 -q 10 30 150 190 -a FCFS SSTF
```
